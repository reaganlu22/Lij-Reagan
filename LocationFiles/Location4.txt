Grand Canyon	86023	PHX	GCN	Known primarily for sightseeing, hiking, backpacking, and camping the Grand Canyon is a mile-deep canyone formed by the Colorado River with tourism areas on the North and South Rim, though only the South Rim is open year round. Please Note: Most visitors to the Grandcanyon fly into the Phoenix airpost even though it is 4 hours away from the South Rim. Suttles can be arranged for around $90 per person each way but it would be more cost effective to rent a car. More information can be found at: https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm
